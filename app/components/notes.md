// this is an input field
// in the end it will effect the display
// perhaps 1 component can be post box
// post list will receive either all records 

//post list will recive array from some other comp, either default, sort, or filter

// app state: filter not empty, render filter view
    // filter view will take state, filter it and then render comp list
    // will it cause problems to have props passed through 2 levels, rather than 1? 


    // post list is even more simple- just takes array and maps through

  // sort can be by votes, or by date/time
